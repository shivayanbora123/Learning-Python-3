# Pythion 2 division will always yeild whole numbers 
# whereas real division is performed in case of Python 3
# Unlike Java where ints require 4 bytes to store it, Python uses 14 bytes

print(100 + 20 -80)
print(2*2)
print(2 / 4)
print(10 / 5) # Returns quotient

print(type(2))

print(5 % 3) # Returns remainder

# 4E2 or 4e2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python
