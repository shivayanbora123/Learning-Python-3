# Learning Python 3
These are the Jupyter Notebooks containing course notes from the [Complete Python 3 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/) course by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/) on Udemy and some personal notes from [The Python Bible](https://www.udemy.com/the-python-bible/) Course on Udemy from [Ziyad Yehia](https://www.udemy.com/user/ziyadyehia2/) for learning Python 3.
